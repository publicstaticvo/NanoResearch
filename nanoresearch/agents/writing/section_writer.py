Instructions: {instructions}

Research Context:
{context}{prior_ctx}

IMPORTANT: Use ONLY the citation keys listed in the CITATION KEYS section above.
For example, write \\cite{{dokholyan1998}} NOT \\cite{{1}} or \\cite{{XXXX}}.
Maintain consistent notation and terminology with any previously written sections.

EVIDENCE INTEGRITY RULES:
- Use exact experiment numbers only when they appear in the REAL EXPERIMENT RESULTS block.
- If the context says results are not available, do not write performance claims, empty result tables,
  placeholder values, estimated ablations, or phrases such as "to be filled", "placeholder", or
  "technical issues during execution".
- For incomplete experiments, write a concise negative-result / execution-risk analysis: describe the
  intended benchmark, the observed failure mode or missing evidence, and the concrete next validation
  step. Do not apologize and do not expose pipeline/tool meta-commentary.
- Do not compare proposed-method validation numbers against public test baselines unless the context
  explicitly provides a canonical baseline comparison.

Output ONLY the LaTeX paragraphs for this section. Do not include \\section command.

FORMAT RULES:
- Do NOT wrap your output in Markdown code fences (```latex ... ``` or ``` ... ```).
- Do NOT insert \\begin{{figure}}...\\end{{figure}} environments; use \\ref{{fig:xxx}}
  to reference figures only — figures are inserted automatically by the pipeline.
- Use bare ~ for non-breaking space before \\ref (e.g. Figure~\\ref{{fig:arch}}),
  NOT \\~{{}} which renders as a tilde accent character in LaTeX."""
